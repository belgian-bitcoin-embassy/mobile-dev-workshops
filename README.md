# Bitcoin and Lightning Mobile Development Workshops

This repository contains materials for Bitcoin and Lightning mobile development workshops.
These workshops are intended for developers or anyone willing to learn how to build Bitcoin and Lightning applications for mobile devices.

## Agenda

During the first workshops, the basic functionalities of Bitcoin and Lightning wallets will be implemented.
After that, more advanced topics can be covered based on the interest and/or contribution of the participants.

- March 4th, 2024: Workshop #1 - Bitcoin on-chain wallet
- April 8th, 2024: Workshop #2 - Lightning wallet
- TBD: Workshop #3 - Lightning Service Provider integration and BOLT12 offers

## Prior knowledge

Anyone can assist, but experience in software development is highly recommended, as explaining basics of programming will take us too far from the main topic.

Experience with mobile development or Bitcoin and Lightning is NOT required.
We think the workshops can be fun and of value to both developers that want to learn about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, as well as Bitcoin and Lightning developers that want to learn about mobile development.

## ⚠️ To do before the workshop

As the workshop will be hands-on, it is required to install some software before attending the workshop and make sure it is working correctly.

Due to time constraints, we will not be able to help with installation issues during the workshop. If you have any problems, please reach out to us beforehand.

## Workshop 2: Lightning Network wallet

In this workshop, we will add Lightning node/wallet functionality to the app like:

- Displaying the spendable Lightning balance
- Funding and opening a Lightning channel
- Generating a Lightning invoice
- Paying different types of payment requests (BOLT11, LNURL, Lightning Address, node public key, etc.)
- Displaying the payment history
- Displaying the channel list
- Closing a Lightning channel

And if time permits:

- Backing up the channels
